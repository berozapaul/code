# 2264. Largest 3-Same-Digit Number in String


You are given a string num representing a large integer. An integer is good if it meets the following conditions:

It is a substring of num with length 3.
It consists of only one unique digit.
Return the maximum good integer as a string or an empty string "" if no such integer exists.

Note:

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
There may be leading zeroes in num or a good integer.


 

### Example 1:
```
Input: num = "6777133339"
Output: "777"
Explanation: There are two distinct good integers: "777" and "333".
"777" is the largest, so we return "777".
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: num = "2300019"
Output: "000"
Explanation: "000" is the only good integer.
 ```

Constraints:
```
1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200
s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.
s1 and s2 do not have leading or trailing spaces.
All the words in s1 and s2 are separated by a single space.
